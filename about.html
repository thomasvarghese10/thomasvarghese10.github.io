            Drew Christopher Brees (/briːz/;[2] born January 15, 1979) is an American football quarterback for the New
            Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL). He had a successful college football career at Purdue
            University, becoming one of the most decorated players in Purdue and Big Ten Conference history. Brees set
            two NCAA records, 13 Big Ten Conference records, and 19 Purdue University records during his college career.
            He remains the Big Ten record-holder in several passing categories, including completions (1,026), attempts
            (1,678), and yards (11,792). Brees was chosen by the San Diego Chargers with the first pick in the second
            round of the 2001 NFL Draft. Brees earned the starting job with the Chargers in 2002 and made the Pro Bowl
            in 2004. Nine months after suffering a dislocation in his right shoulder joint and a tear of the labrum and
            rotator cuff, Brees signed with the Saints as a free agent in 2006. He experienced immediate success in New
            Orleans, leading the Saints to their first-ever Super Bowl in Super Bowl XLIV and helping the team to a
            31–17 victory over the Indianapolis Colts.
            <br>
            <br>
        </body>Since joining the Saints, Brees has led all NFL quarterbacks in touchdowns, passing yards, and 300-yard
        games. Brees holds NFL records for career pass completions, career completion percentage, career passing yards,
        and career touchdown passes. He is also second in regular season career pass attempts, third in regular season
        career passer rating and fourth in postseason career passer rating. In 2012, he broke Johnny Unitas's
        long-standing record of consecutive games with a touchdown pass. He has led the NFL in passing yards a record
        seven times and in passing touchdowns a record-tying four times. Brees has made the Pro Bowl 13 times, was the
        NFL's Comeback Player of the Year in 2004, was the Offensive Player of the Year in 2008 and 2011, and was the
        MVP of Super Bowl XLIV. Sports Illustrated named Brees its 2010 Sportsman of the Year. Brees is regarded as one
        of the best pure passers in NFL history, and has been hailed as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[3]
